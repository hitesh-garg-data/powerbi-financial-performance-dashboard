- **Medium and High discount bands** outperform low/no-discount strategies in profit margin.
- **Strong revenue does not guarantee profitability** due to COGS and OpEx erosion.
- **United States shows a revenue–profit paradox**, generating the highest revenue but negative net profit.
- Certain customer segments (Enterprise & Small Business) also show negative profitability.
